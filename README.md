# McDonalds-App
In the app, two types of users will be able to login: clients and employees. The two will have different benefits in the app.
Both types of users will be able to make online orders, or add their in-store orders to their account. This way they will be able to get new deals and points, which will later be used in the purchases from the future.
When making an order, people will be able to turn the mains into menus/combos.
